    "note": "Muklom is a language spoken by a few thousand people in Northeast India, a linguistic hotspot that harbors languages from four different families: Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai, and Indo-European. Muklom  belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family. The letter q is pronounced as a glottal stop, the sound in the middle of English “uh oh”. The combination qh is pronounced like the last two letters in the name of the composer Bach in German. The accents on the Muklom words represent different tones—put simply, the accent ['] stands for a high-pitched syllable, and [`] stands for a low-pitched syllable.",
